# SIH-Alpha

Creating a web application platform, powered by Next.js and React for frontend development and utilizing TailwindCSS for design, is designed to facilitate connections between patients and doctors. Python is employed for backend development.

Utilizing OpenCV for facial recognition to efficiently assess the availability of doctors within the system.

Implementing cutting-edge NLP techniques to offer doctor recommendations tailored to users' specific health issues, factoring in drug reactions and symptoms. The tech stack includes Python, Natural Language Processing libraries (such as NLTK or spaCy), and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for model development.

Implementing a real-time database system using a robust RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) like PostgreSQL or MySQL to seamlessly update and maintain doctor availability. This database will be integrated with the web application using SQL or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework like SQLAlchemy for Python.


User Registration and Profile Creation:
Patients register and provide personal information and medical history.
Profiles help recommend doctors and assess health needs.

  Doctor Availability Detection:
Facial recognition tracks doctors entering/leaving.
Updates real-time availability status.

  Appointment Scheduling:
Users find doctors using NLP recommendations.
Book appointments based on doctor availability.

  Real-Time Database Management:
Maintains up-to-date data on doctors and patients.
Ensures efficient appointment allocation.

  Patient Experience Improvement:
Aims to reduce patient wait times.
Provides personalized doctor recommendations.

## Process

The patient arrives and checks in with the tool.

The tool uses NLP to understand the patient's needs and preferences, such as their preferred doctor, specialty, and time of day.

The tool then uses facial recognition to identify the doctors who are present in the hospital.

The tool then uses a real-time database to check the doctors' availability.

The tool then assigns the patient to the most suitable doctor and books their appointment.

## UI/UX

The patient is then notified of their appointment time and location.
